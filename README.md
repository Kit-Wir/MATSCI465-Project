# MATSCI 465 Project — Physics-guided unsupervised segmentation of 4D-STEM

This project implements a physics-guided pipeline to segment 4D-STEM datasets using radial diffraction fingerprints + PCA + unsupervised clustering (KMeans/GMM).

## Files
- `pipeline.py` — reusable pipeline (`run_pipeline`)
- `01_NiW.ipynb` — applies pipeline to experimental Ni–W 4D-STEM data
- `02_Synthetic.ipynb` — generates synthetic 4D-STEM with known precipitates and validates segmentation (IoU/F1)

## Data
Ni–W dataset is a `.dm4` file (~1.2 GB) and is not stored in this repo.  
Download it from the public source and place it locally, then update the path in `01_NiW.ipynb`.

Synthetic data is generated by `02_Synthetic.ipynb`.
